[PDF]\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThe COVID-19 pandemic supercharged the spread of fake\nnews, misinformation, and conspiracy theories worldwide. Using a\nnational probability sample of adults fromthe New Zealand Attitudes and\nValues Study during 2020 (17–99 years old; M=48.59, SD=13.86; 63% women,\n37% men; N=41,487), we examined the associations between agreement with\ngeneral conspiracy beliefs and political indicators of intention to vote\nand satisfaction with government, alongside political factors\nincludingtrust in politicians, political efficacy, identity centrality,\nand political ideology. Left-wing political ideology, trust in\npoliticians, and political efficacy accounted for most of the explained\nvariance in satisfaction with the government. General conspiracy belief\nwas also a unique contributor to lower satisfaction with the government.\nWe also found a curvilinear relationship between political ideology with\nheightened belief in conspiracies at both ideological extremes and the\ncentre. Findings are discussed in terms of the consequences of\nconspiracy belief on democratic engagement.\n\n\nJolley, D., Marques, M.D., Cookson, D.

However, the consequences of\nconspiracy beliefs span far beyond the topic of COVID-19. This review\nshines a spotlight on how conspiracy beliefs could impact public and\npersonal health (e.g., vaccine uptake), democratic citizenship (e.g.,\npolitical engagement), intergroup relations (e.g., prejudice and\ndiscrimination), and may inspire violence and extremism. We argue that\nconspiracy beliefs are likely to have the power to mobilise citizens in\nways detrimental to a smooth-running society. We conclude the review by\noffering a range of fruitful avenues for future investigation.\n\n\nMarques, M.D., Douglas, K.M., & Jolley, D.\n(2022).

Recent research suggests that individuals\nare attracted to conspiracy theories to satisfy three important and\nfundamental psychological needs: epistemic, existential, and social\nneeds. Understanding these underlying motivations associated with\nhealth-related conspiracy theories can help address patients’ beliefs.\nDebunking and inoculation are discussed as approaches that can be used\nto address patients’ belief in health-related conspiracy\ntheories.\n\n\nMarques, M.D., Ling, M., Williams, M.N., Kerr, J.R.,\n& McLennan, J.

International research suggests that such beliefs\nare quite common and that conspiracy theories may serve three basic\npsychological motives (i.e., epistemic, existential, and relational) for\nindividuals. Yet, little is known about conspiracy theory awareness or\nbelief in Australasia. We report the first large systematic\ninvestigation of system justifying motives using twonationally\nrepresentative samples of Australians (n = 1,011) and New\nZealanders (n = 754). Our findings show that almost all are\naware of local and international conspiracies, the majority endorse one\nor more, and that all three psychological motives consistently relate to\nconspiracy belief, but not to awareness. In a series of hierarchical\nmultiple regressions, we find that relational (i.e., increased anomie\nand disillusionment with the government) and existential motives (i.e.,\nless trust in others and increased religiosity) are uniquely and\nrelatively more important than epistemic needs (i.e., decreased analytic\nthinking) as predictors of increased local and international conspiracy\nbelief. Findings are discussed in terms of the importance of\nunderstanding conspiracy theories as an ideological belief system that\nmay function to serve underlying psychological motives.\n\n\nWilliams, M.N., Marques, M.D., Hill, S.R., Kerr,\nJ.R., & Ling, M.

British Journal of Social Psychology, 61(3),\n1011-1031. https://doi.org/10.1111/bjso.12518\n[PDF] Impact Factor =\n4.691\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nA substantial minority of the public express belief in\nconspiracy theories. A robust phenomenon in this area is that people who\nbelieve one conspiracy theory are more likely to believe in others. But\nthe reason for this “positive manifold” of belief in conspiracy theories\nis unclear. One possibility is that a single underlying latent factor\n(e.g., “conspiracism”) causes variation in belief in specific conspiracy\ntheories. Another possibility is that beliefs in various conspiracy\ntheories support one another in a mutually reinforcing network of\nbeliefs (the “monological belief system” theory). While the monological\ntheory has been influential in the literature, the fact that it can be\noperationalised as a statistical network model has not previously been\nrecognised . In this study, we therefore tested both the unidimensional\nfactor model and the monological/network model. Participants were 1553\nAmerican adults recruited via Prolific. Belief in conspiracies was\nmeasured using an adapted version of the Belief in Conspiracy Theories\nInventory. The fit of the two competing models was evaluated both by\nusing van Bork et al.’s (2018, 2019) method for testing network\nvs. unidimensional factor models, as well as by evaluating goodness of\nfit to the sample covariance matrix. In both cases, evaluation of fit\naccording to our preregistered inferential criteria favoured the network\nmodel. This finding is consistent with the monological belief system\ntheory, and inconsistent with a unidimensional factor model\nexplanation.\n\n\nMarques, M.D., Kerr, J.R., Williams, M.N., Ling, M.,\n& McLennan, J.

We suggest such\nscience-based technological innovations are rejected by some because\nthey are perceived to be advanced as part of a conspiracy. In nationally\nrepresentative samples (Australia n = 1,011; New Zealand\nn = 754) we report the associations between five conspiracism\nfacets and anti-science attitudes. Results indicate broad public\nopposition to GM food and use of nuclear power, but more acceptance of\nrenewable power, potable recycled water, 5G networks, and childhood\nvaccinations. There were small to moderate associations between the\nrejection of scientific innovations and conspiracism. Multivariate\nmodels estimating unique associations of conspiracism facets with\nanti-science attitudes suggested several novel and important\nrelationships, particularly for childhood vaccination, GM food, and 5G\nnetworks. We discuss the importance of examining factors such as\nconspiracism in understanding what may motivate and sustain rejection of\nscientific evidence-based claims about socially contentious\ntechnological innovations.\n\n\nNatoli, E.E., & Marques, M.D. (2021).

British Journal of Social Psychology, 60(3),\npp. 902-923. https://doi.org/10.1111/bjso.12426\n[PDF] Impact Factor =\n4.691\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nHealth-related conspiracy theories can undermine the\ntrustworthiness of actors and institutions and may impact an\nindividual’s intention to seek help. Across 3 experimental studies we\ninvestigated the consequences of exposure to an antidepressant\nconspiracy theory on general intentions to seek medical and\npsychological help. Study 1 participants (N = 299) were\nrandomly allocated to read one of three articles (pro-conspiracy,\nanti-conspiracy, control) after which they completed measures of\nconspiracy endorsement, trust, powerlessness and health-seeking\nintentions. Results suggested that exposure to antidepressant conspiracy\ntheories significantly reduced individual’s intention to seek help\nindirectly through decreased trust in health authorities, but not\nhealth-industry related powerlessness. In two additional pre-registered\nstudies we found some support for these findings. While Study 2\n(N = 244) found no support for a direct or indirect\nrelationship between conspiracy exposure and health-seeking intentions,\nan exploratory analysis highlighted the importance of gender differences\nwhen investigating conspiracy exposure on intentions. Study 3\n(N = 247) replicated Study 1 findings, highlighting that\nantidepressant conspiracy theories decrease health-seeking intentions\nindirectly through decreased trust and increased powerlessness. Mere\nexposure to antidepressant conspiracy theories had significant indirect\nconsequences on general health-seeking intentions.\n\n\n\n",
