Using a\nnational probability sample of adults fromthe New Zealand Attitudes and\nValues Study during 2020 (17–99 years old; M = 48.59,\nSD = 13.86; 63% women, 37% men; N = 41,487), we\nexamined the associations between agreement with general conspiracy\nbeliefs and political indicators of intention to vote and satisfaction\nwith government, alongside political factors includingtrust in\npoliticians, political efficacy, identity centrality, and political\nideology. Left-wing political ideology, trust in politicians, and\npolitical efficacy accounted for most of the explained variance in\nsatisfaction with the government. General conspiracy belief was also a\nunique contributor to lower satisfaction with the government. We also\nfound a curvilinear relationship between political ideology with\nheightened belief in conspiracies at both ideological extremes and the\ncentre. Findings are discussed in terms of the consequences of\nconspiracy belief on democratic engagement.\n\n\nJolley, D., Marques, M.D., Cookson, D.

However, the consequences of\nconspiracy beliefs span far beyond the topic of COVID-19. This review\nshines a spotlight on how conspiracy beliefs could impact public and\npersonal health (e.g., vaccine uptake), democratic citizenship (e.g.,\npolitical engagement), intergroup relations (e.g., prejudice and\ndiscrimination), and may inspire violence and extremism. We argue that\nconspiracy beliefs are likely to have the power to mobilise citizens in\nways detrimental to a smooth-running society. We conclude the review by\noffering a range of fruitful avenues for future investigation.\n\n\nMarques, M.D., Douglas, K.M., & Jolley, D.\n(2022).

Recent research suggests that individuals\nare attracted to conspiracy theories to satisfy three important and\nfundamental psychological needs: epistemic, existential, and social\nneeds. Understanding these underlying motivations associated with\nhealth-related conspiracy theories can help address patients’ beliefs.\nDebunking and inoculation are discussed as approaches that can be used\nto address patients’ belief in health-related conspiracy\ntheories.\n\n\nMarques, M.D., Ling, M., Williams, M.N., Kerr, J.R.,\n& McLennan, J.

Political Psychology,\n43(1), 177-198. https://doi.org/10.1111/pops.12746\n[PDF]Impact Factor =\n4.333\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nBelief in conspiracies is not restricted to the fringe\ndwellers of society. International research suggests that such beliefs\nare quite common and that conspiracy theories may serve three basic\npsychological motives (i.e., epistemic, existential, and relational) for\nindividuals. Yet, little is known about conspiracy theory awareness or\nbelief in Australasia. We report the first large systematic\ninvestigation of system justifying motives using twonationally\nrepresentative samples of Australians (n = 1,011) and New\nZealanders (n = 754). Our findings show that almost all are\naware of local and international conspiracies, the majority endorse one\nor more, and that all three psychological motives consistently relate to\nconspiracy belief, but not to awareness. In a series of hierarchical\nmultiple regressions, we find that relational (i.e., increased anomie\nand disillusionment with the government) and existential motives (i.e.,\nless trust in others and increased religiosity) are uniquely and\nrelatively more important than epistemic needs (i.e., decreased analytic\nthinking) as predictors of increased local and international conspiracy\nbelief. Findings are discussed in terms of the importance of\nunderstanding conspiracy theories as an ideological belief system that\nmay function to serve underlying psychological motives.\n\n\nWilliams, M.N., Marques, M.D., Hill, S.R., Kerr,\nJ.R., & Ling, M.

Registered report.\nBritish Journal of Social Psychology, 61(3), 1011-1031. https://doi.org/10.1111/bjso.12518\n[PDF]Impact Factor =\n4.691\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nA substantial minority of the public express belief in\nconspiracy theories. A robust phenomenon in this area is that people who\nbelieve one conspiracy theory are more likely to believe in others. But\nthe reason for this “positive manifold” of belief in conspiracy theories\nis unclear. One possibility is that a single underlying latent factor\n(e.g., “conspiracism”) causes variation in belief in specific conspiracy\ntheories. Another possibility is that beliefs in various conspiracy\ntheories support one another in a mutually reinforcing network of\nbeliefs (the “monological belief system” theory). While the monological\ntheory has been influential in the literature, the fact that it can be\noperationalised as a statistical network model has not previously been\nrecognised . In this study, we therefore tested both the unidimensional\nfactor model and the monological/network model. Participants were 1553\nAmerican adults recruited via Prolific. Belief in conspiracies was\nmeasured using an adapted version of the Belief in Conspiracy Theories\nInventory. The fit of the two competing models was evaluated both by\nusing van Bork et al.’s (2018, 2019) method for testing network\nvs. unidimensional factor models, as well as by evaluating goodness of\nfit to the sample covariance matrix. In both cases, evaluation of fit\naccording to our preregistered inferential criteria favoured the network\nmodel. This finding is consistent with the monological belief system\ntheory, and inconsistent with a unidimensional factor model\nexplanation.\n\n\nMarques, M.D., Kerr, J.R., Williams, M.N., Ling, M.,\n& McLennan, J.

We suggest such\nscience-based technological innovations are rejected by some because\nthey are perceived to be advanced as part of a conspiracy. In nationally\nrepresentative samples (Australia n = 1,011; New Zealand\nn = 754) we report the associations between five conspiracism\nfacets and anti-science attitudes. Results indicate broad public\nopposition to GM food and use of nuclear power, but more acceptance of\nrenewable power, potable recycled water, 5G networks, and childhood\nvaccinations. There were small to moderate associations between the\nrejection of scientific innovations and conspiracism. Multivariate\nmodels estimating unique associations of conspiracism facets with\nanti-science attitudes suggested several novel and important\nrelationships, particularly for childhood vaccination, GM food, and 5G\nnetworks. We discuss the importance of examining factors such as\nconspiracism in understanding what may motivate and sustain rejection of\nscientific evidence-based claims about socially contentious\ntechnological innovations.\n\n\nNatoli, E.E., & Marques, M.D. (2021).

Across 3 experimental studies we\ninvestigated the consequences of exposure to an antidepressant\nconspiracy theory on general intentions to seek medical and\npsychological help. Study 1 participants (N = 299) were\nrandomly allocated to read one of three articles (pro-conspiracy,\nanti-conspiracy, control) after which they completed measures of\nconspiracy endorsement, trust, powerlessness and health-seeking\nintentions. Results suggested that exposure to antidepressant conspiracy\ntheories significantly reduced individual’s intention to seek help\nindirectly through decreased trust in health authorities, but not\nhealth-industry related powerlessness. In two additional pre-registered\nstudies we found some support for these findings. While Study 2\n(N = 244) found no support for a direct or indirect\nrelationship between conspiracy exposure and health-seeking intentions,\nan exploratory analysis highlighted the importance of gender differences\nwhen investigating conspiracy exposure on intentions. Study 3\n(N = 247) replicated Study 1 findings, highlighting that\nantidepressant conspiracy theories decrease health-seeking intentions\nindirectly through decreased trust and increased powerlessness. Mere\nexposure to antidepressant conspiracy theories had significant indirect\nconsequences on general health-seeking intentions.\nOther publications\n\nMarques, M.D., Sibley, C.G., Wilson, M.S., Bulbulia,\nJ., Osborne, D., Yogeeswaran, K., Lee, C.H.J., Duck, I.M., Douglas,\nK.M., & Cichocka, A. (2022). Psychological predictors of COVID-19\nvaccination in New Zealand. New Zealand Journal of Psychology,\n51(1), 10-27. [PDF]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nIs it possible to predict COVID-19 vaccination status\nprior to the existence and availability ofCOVID-19 vaccines? Here, we\npresent a logistic model by regressing decisions to vaccinate in late\n2021 on lagged sociodemographic, health, social, and political\nindicators from 2019 ina sample of New Zealand adults aged between 18\nand 94 (Mage = 52.92, SD = 14.10; 62.21% women;\nN = 5324). We explain 31% of the variance in decision making\nacross New Zealand. Significant predictors of being unvaccinated were\nbeing younger, more deprived, reporting less satisfaction with general\npractitioners, lower levels of neuroticism, greater levels of subjective\nhealth and meaning in life, higher distrust in science and in the\npolice, lower satisfaction in the government, as well as political\nconservatism. Additional cross-sectional models specified using the\nsame, and additional COVID-19-specific factors are also presented. These\nfindings reveal that vaccination decisions are neither artefacts of\ncontext norchance, but rather can be predicted in advance of the\navailability of vaccines.\n\n\nMarques, M.D., Feather, N.T., Austin, D.E.J., &\nSibley, C.G.

These attitudes reflect a tension between achievement,\nauthority, and equality. In a pre-registered study (Study 1: N\n= 47,951), and a replication (Study 2: N = 5,569), of two\nrepresentative New Zealand samples we investigated how social dominance\norientation, right-wing authoritarianism, political ideologies and\nself-esteem predicted favoring the fall of the tall poppy. Novel\nfindings showed individuals high in social dominance orientation favored\nthe fall of the tall poppy. In both studies, high authoritarian\naggression and submission, and low conventionalism (in Study 1 only)\nwere also associated with negative tall poppy attitudes. So too were\nindividuals with lower self-esteem and who were less conservative in\ntheir political ideology.

Sleep Health, 78(3), 368-374. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2020.12.005\n[PDF]Impact Factor =\n4.450\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nObjective: To investigate the annual temporal\nordering of sleep quantity and psychological distress, separating\nbetween-person stability from within-person change. Design:\nRandom-intercepts cross-lagged panel model using six annual waves of\nlongitudinal data from the New Zealand Attitudes Values Study postal\nquestionnaire.Participants: New Zealand Attitudes Values Study\nrespondents in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 (Ns = 17,890;\n15,757; 13,904; 21,849; 17,031; and 47,462). Measurements:\nParticipants were asked, “During the past month, on average, how many\nhours of actual sleep did you get per night?” and responded to the K6\npsychological distress scale each year. They also reported their\ndemographic characteristics. Results: Identified longitudinal\nassociations between sleep duration and psychological distress in a\ntraditional cross-lagged panel model were mostly attributable to the\nstability of the between-person differences in sleep duration and\npsychological distress. We provide evidence to suggest that increased\nsleep duration as indicated over a short period of time (i.e.,one month)\npredicted lower within-person levels of psychological distress the\nfollowing year.Psychological distress did not predict sleep duration, in\ncontrast. Conclusions: Our analyses suggest that sleep duration\nin this sample of New Zealanders precedes psychological distress. This\nis significant given the propensity for short sleep in this sample and\nissues of poor mental health and short sleep among low SES indigenous\nmembersof this community. The promotion of adequate sleep duration may\nyield positive gains in psychological well-being\n\n\nSteffens, M.S., Dunn, A.G., Marques, M.D., Danchin,\nM., Witteman, H.O., & Leask, J. (2021). Addressing Myths and Vaccine\nHesitancy: A Randomized Trial. Pediatrics, e2020049304. https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-049304\n[PDF]Impact Factor = 5.417\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nOBJECTIVES: Evidence on repeating vaccination\nmisinformation or “myths” in debunking text is inconclusive; repeating\nmyths may unintentionally increase agreement with myths or help\ndiscredit myths. In this study we aimed to compare the effect of\nrepeating vaccination myths and other text-based debunking strategies on\nparents’ agreement with myths and their intention to vaccinate their\nchildren. METHODS: For this online experiment we recruited 788\nparents of children aged 0 to 5 years; 454 (58%) completed the study. We\ncompared 3 text-based debunking strategies (repeating myths, posing\nquestions, or making factual statements) and a control. We measured\nchanges in agreement with myths and intention to vaccinate immediately\nafter the intervention and at least 1 week later. The primary analysis\ncompared the change in agreement with vaccination myths from baseline,\nbetween groups, at each time point after the intervention.\nRESULTS: There was no evidence that repeating myths increased\nagreement with myths compared with the other debunking strategies or the\ncontrol. Posing questions significantly decreased agreement with myths\nimmediately after the intervention compared with the control\n(difference: −0.30 points, 99.17% confidence interval: −0.58 to −0.02, P\n= .004, d = 0.39). There was no evidence of a difference between other\ndebunking strategies or the control at either time point, or on\nintention to vaccinate. CONCLUSIONS: Debunking strategies that\nrepeat vaccination myths do not appear to be inferior to strategies that\ndo not repeat myths.\n\n\nMarques, M.D., Elphinstone B., Critchley C.R., &\nEigenberger, M.E.

Personality and Individual Differences,\n114, 167-174. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2017.04.001\n[PDF]Impact Factor = 3.004\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThis paper describes the development of a brief scale to\nmeasure anti-intellectualism, the degree to which one experiences either\npositive or negative affect while engaged in epistemic activities such\nas conceptual integration. Using seven samples, the study examined\nseveral psychometric components of the measure, including equivalency\nacross community and student/convenience populations, temporal\nstability, and indications of different forms of validity. The scale was\ndesigned to be a brief, reliable and valid measure of individual\ndifferences in the degree to which individuals value affect-reinforced\nneed for intellectual engagement. These results suggest that the\nAnti-Intellectualism Scale may provide a useful tool for the examination\nof differences in the desire to engage in intellectually challenging\nactivities, and subsequent outcomes such as vocational interest,\nacademic achievement, and democratic citizenship.\n\n\nHoneyman K.L., Stukas A.A., & Marques M.D.\n(2016). Human trafficking: factors that influence willingness to combat\nthe issue. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 46, 529-543.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/jasp.12381\n[PDF]Impact Factor = 2.122\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nHuman trafficking involves severe violations of human\nrights and social action is required to combat it. Past research has\nidentified emotional reactions to victims of trafficking, as well as the\nperceived cost and efficacy of actions, as significant predictors of\nwillingness to get involved. We surveyed 216 Australians (70% female) to\nassess their perceptions of sex and labor trafficking and actions to\nreduce them. Results demonstrated that women reported greater personal\ndistress (but not empathy) for victims than men, which was associated\nwith greater willingness to take action. Women also perceived available\nactions to be more efficacious than men, which predicted willingness,\nwhile perceived cost of actions did not. Implications for promoting\nsocial action to reduce human trafficking are discussed.\n\n\nMarques, M.D., Critchley, C.R., & Walshe, J.\n(2015). Attitudes to genetically modified food over time: how trust in\norganizations and the media cycle predict support. Public\nUnderstanding of Science, 24, 601-618. https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662514542372\n[PDF]Impact Factor = 3.702\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThis research examined public opinion toward genetically\nmodified plants and animals for food, and how trust in organizations and\nmedia coverage explained attitudes toward these organisms. Nationally\nrepresentative samples (*N8 = 8821) over 10 years showed Australians\nwere less positive toward genetically modified animals compared to\ngenetically modified plants for food, especially in years where media\ncoverage was high. Structural equation modeling found that positive\nattitudes toward different genetically modified organisms for food were\nsignificantly associated with higher trust in scientists and regulators\n(e.g. governments), and with lower trust in watchdogs\n(e.g. environmental movement). Public trust in scientists and watchdogs\nwas a stronger predictor of attitudes toward the use of genetically\nmodified plants for food than animals, but only when media coverage was\nlow. Results are discussed regarding the moral acceptability of\ngenetically modified organisms for food, the media’s role in shaping\npublic opinion, and the role public trust in organizations has on\nattitudes toward genetically modified organisms.\n\n\n\n",
