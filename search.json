Increased belief in vaccination conspiracy theories predicts increases in vaccination hesitancy and powerlessness: Results from a longitudinal study. Social Science & Medicine.\r\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115522\r\n[PDF]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nRationale: Vaccinations are an important part of a public health strategy against preventable diseases, and uptake is influenced by factors including hesitancy. The belief of vaccine related misinformation including anti-vaccination conspiracy theories has been found to be associated with increased vaccine hesitancy.\r\nObjective: While research suggests that these conspiracy theory beliefs may arise to satisfy unmet needs such as restoring loss of personal control, somewhat ironically these anti-vaccination conspiracy theories may frustrate these needs. This study examined the causal relationships between vaccination hesitancy, vaccination conspiracy theories, and vaccination related powerlessness.\r\nMethods: Using a stationary random intercepts cross lagged panel model, we investigated the temporal ordering of vaccination hesitancy, powerlessness, and vaccination conspiracy theory beliefs in a sample of Australian adults (N = 500) in a longitudinal study with 5-timepoints over 4-months between June and October 2021.\r\nResults: Results from a random intercept cross-lagged model, that separates between-person stability from within-person change, suggested that increased belief in vaccination conspiracy theories was associated with future increases in vaccination hesitancy and powerlessness (but not vice versa). Findings also showed that increases in vaccination hesitancy and conspiracy theory beliefs predicted respective increases from a person’s trait-level mean at subsequent timepoints.\r\nConclusions: Vaccination conspiracy theories appear to increase vaccination powerlessness and hesitancy, rather than satisfying an unmet need for personal control.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarques, M.D., Hill, S.R., Clarke, E.J.R., Williams, M.N., Ling, M., Kerr, J.R., Douglas, K.M., Cichocka,\r\nA., & Sibley, C.G.

Using a national probability sample of adults fromthe New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study during 2020 (17–99 years old; M = 48.59, SD = 13.86; 63% women, 37% men; N = 41,487), we examined the associations between agreement with general conspiracy beliefs and political indicators of intention to vote and satisfaction with government, alongside political factors includingtrust in politicians, political efficacy, identity centrality, and political ideology. Left-wing political ideology, trust in politicians, and political efficacy accounted for most of the explained variance in satisfaction with the government. General conspiracy belief was also a unique contributor to lower satisfaction with the government. We also found a curvilinear relationship between political ideology with heightened belief in conspiracies at both ideological extremes and the centre. Findings are discussed in terms of the consequences of conspiracy belief on democratic engagement.\r\n\r\n\r\nJolley, D., Marques, M.D., Cookson, D. (2022).

However, the consequences of conspiracy beliefs span far beyond the topic of COVID-19. This review shines a spotlight on how conspiracy beliefs could impact public and personal health (e.g., vaccine uptake), democratic citizenship (e.g., political engagement), intergroup relations (e.g., prejudice and discrimination), and may inspire violence and extremism. We argue that conspiracy beliefs are likely to have the power to mobilise citizens in ways detrimental to a smooth-running society. We conclude the review by offering a range of fruitful avenues for future investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarques, M.D., Douglas, K.M., & Jolley, D. (2022).

They are widespread and are associated with important health attitudes, intentions, and behaviours. Recent research suggests that individuals are attracted to conspiracy theories to satisfy three important and fundamental psychological needs: epistemic, existential, and social needs. Understanding these underlying motivations associated with health-related conspiracy theories can help address patients’ beliefs. Debunking and inoculation are discussed as approaches that can be used to address patients’ belief in health-related conspiracy theories.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarques, M.D., Ling, M., Williams, M.N., Kerr, J.R., & McLennan, J.

International research suggests that such beliefs are quite common and that conspiracy theories may serve three basic psychological motives (i.e., epistemic, existential, and relational) for individuals. Yet, little is known about conspiracy theory awareness or belief in Australasia. We report the first large systematic investigation of system justifying motives using twonationally representative samples of Australians (n = 1,011) and New Zealanders (n = 754). Our findings show that almost all are aware of local and international conspiracies, the majority endorse one or more, and that all three psychological motives consistently relate to conspiracy belief, but not to awareness. In a series of hierarchical multiple regressions, we find that relational (i.e., increased anomie and disillusionment with the government) and existential motives (i.e., less trust in others and increased religiosity) are uniquely and relatively more important than epistemic needs (i.e., decreased analytic thinking) as predictors of increased local and international conspiracy belief. Findings are discussed in terms of the importance of understanding conspiracy theories as an ideological belief system that may function to serve underlying psychological motives.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliams, M.N., Marques, M.D., Hill, S.R., Kerr, J.R., & Ling, M. (2022). Why are beliefs in different conspiracy theories positively correlated across individuals? Testing monological network vs. unidimensional factor model explanations. Registered report. British Journal of Social Psychology, 61(3), 1011-1031. https://doi.org/10.1111/bjso.12518 [PDF]Impact Factor = 4.691\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nA substantial minority of the public express belief in conspiracy theories. A robust phenomenon in this area is that people who believe one conspiracy theory are more likely to believe in others. But the reason for this “positive manifold” of belief in conspiracy theories is unclear. One possibility is that a single underlying latent factor (e.g., “conspiracism”) causes variation in belief in specific conspiracy theories. Another possibility is that beliefs in various conspiracy theories support one another in a mutually reinforcing network of beliefs (the “monological belief system” theory). While the monological theory has been influential in the literature, the fact that it can be operationalised as a statistical network model has not previously been recognised . In this study, we therefore tested both the unidimensional factor model and the monological/network model. Participants were 1553 American adults recruited via Prolific. Belief in conspiracies was measured using an adapted version of the Belief in Conspiracy Theories Inventory. The fit of the two competing models was evaluated both by using van Bork et al.’s (2018, 2019) method for testing network vs. unidimensional factor models, as well as by evaluating goodness of fit to the sample covariance matrix. In both cases, evaluation of fit according to our preregistered inferential criteria favoured the network model. This finding is consistent with the monological belief system theory, and inconsistent with a unidimensional factor model explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarques, M.D., Kerr, J.R., Williams, M.N., Ling, M., & McLennan, J.

We suggest such science-based technological innovations are rejected by some because they are perceived to be advanced as part of a conspiracy. In nationally representative samples (Australia n = 1,011; New Zealand n = 754) we report the associations between five conspiracism facets and anti-science attitudes. Results indicate broad public opposition to GM food and use of nuclear power, but more acceptance of renewable power, potable recycled water, 5G networks, and childhood vaccinations. There were small to moderate associations between the rejection of scientific innovations and conspiracism. Multivariate models estimating unique associations of conspiracism facets with anti-science attitudes suggested several novel and important relationships, particularly for childhood vaccination, GM food, and 5G networks. We discuss the importance of examining factors such as conspiracism in understanding what may motivate and sustain rejection of scientific evidence-based claims about socially contentious technological innovations.\r\n\r\n\r\nNatoli, E.E., & Marques, M.D. (2021). The antidepressant hoax: Conspiracy theories decrease health-seeking intentions. British Journal of Social Psychology, 60(3), 902-923. https://doi.org/10.1111/bjso.12426 [PDF]Impact Factor = 4.691\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nHealth-related conspiracy theories can undermine the trustworthiness of actors and institutions and may impact an individual’s intention to seek help. Across 3 experimental studies we investigated the consequences of exposure to an antidepressant conspiracy theory on general intentions to seek medical and psychological help. Study 1 participants (N = 299) were randomly allocated to read one of three articles (pro-conspiracy, anti-conspiracy, control) after which they completed measures of conspiracy endorsement, trust, powerlessness and health-seeking intentions. Results suggested that exposure to antidepressant conspiracy theories significantly reduced individual’s intention to seek help indirectly through decreased trust in health authorities, but not health-industry related powerlessness. In two additional pre-registered studies we found some support for these findings. While Study 2 (N = 244) found no support for a direct or indirect relationship between conspiracy exposure and health-seeking intentions, an exploratory analysis highlighted the importance of gender differences when investigating conspiracy exposure on intentions. Study 3 (N = 247) replicated Study 1 findings, highlighting that antidepressant conspiracy theories decrease health-seeking intentions indirectly through decreased trust and increased powerlessness. Mere exposure to antidepressant conspiracy theories had significant indirect consequences on general health-seeking intentions.\r\nOther publications\r\n\r\nJarman, H., McLean, S.A., Paxton, S.J., Sibley, C.G., & Marques, M.D. (19 September 2022). Examination of the temporal sequence between social media use and well-being in a representative sample of adults. Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-022-02363-2 [PDF]Impact Factor = 4.328\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nGiven insufficient prospective evidence for relationships between social media use and well-being among adults, the present study examined the temporal sequence between social media use and psychological distress and life satisfaction, and explored age and gender differences. A representative sample of adults (N = 7331; 62.4% women; Mage = 51.94; SD = 13.48; 15–94 years) were surveyed annually across four waves. Cross-lagged panel models demonstrated bidirectional relationships between social media use and well-being. Higher psychological distress and lower life satisfaction predicted higher social media use more strongly than the reverse direction, with effects particularly pronounced for the impact of psychological distress. Although the patterns of findings were relatively consistent across age and gender, results suggested that women and middle- and older-aged adults experience detrimental effects of social media use on well-being, which may drive subsequent increased use of social media. The bidirectional relationships suggest that adults who experience psychological distress or lower life satisfaction may seek to use social media as a way to alleviate poor well-being. However, paradoxically, this maladaptive coping mechanism appears to drive increased social media use which in turn can exacerbate poor well-being. Clinicians should be aware of these bidirectional relationships and work with clients towards replacing ineffective strategies with more helpful coping approaches. As this study used a simplistic measure of social media use, future research should address this limitation and explore nuanced relationships afforded by assessing specific social media activities or exposure to certain types of content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarques, M.D., Sibley, C.G., Wilson, M.S., Bulbulia, J., Osborne, D., Yogeeswaran, K., Lee, C.H.J., Duck, I.M., Douglas, K.M., & Cichocka, A.

Here, we present a logistic model by regressing decisions to vaccinate in late 2021 on lagged sociodemographic, health, social, and political indicators from 2019 ina sample of New Zealand adults aged between 18 and 94 (Mage = 52.92, SD = 14.10; 62.21% women; N = 5324). We explain 31% of the variance in decision making across New Zealand. Significant predictors of being unvaccinated were being younger, more deprived, reporting less satisfaction with general practitioners, lower levels of neuroticism, greater levels of subjective health and meaning in life, higher distrust in science and in the police, lower satisfaction in the government, as well as political conservatism. Additional cross-sectional models specified using the same, and additional COVID-19-specific factors are also presented. These findings reveal that vaccination decisions are neither artefacts of context norchance, but rather can be predicted in advance of the availability of vaccines.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarques, M.D., Feather, N.T., Austin, D.E.J., & Sibley, C.G.

These attitudes reflect a tension between achievement, authority, and equality. In a pre-registered study (Study 1: N = 47,951), and a replication (Study 2: N = 5,569), of two representative New Zealand samples we investigated how social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism, political ideologies and self-esteem predicted favoring the fall of the tall poppy. Novel findings showed individuals high in social dominance orientation favored the fall of the tall poppy. In both studies, high authoritarian aggression and submission, and low conventionalism (in Study 1 only) were also associated with negative tall poppy attitudes. So too were individuals with lower self-esteem and who were less conservative in their political ideology. These findings advance our understanding of how group-based hierarchy and inequality relate to attitudes toward individuals in high-status positions.\r\n\r\n\r\nHall, A., McLennan, J., Marques, M.D., & Bearman, C.

International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, 67, 102667. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102667Impact Factor = 2.896\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nWith increasing numbers of householders living in high bushfire (wildfire) risk areas, there is a need to better understand householders’ bushfire risk perceptions. In the community bushfire safety research literature, there appears to be no consensus on how best to conceptualise and measure householders’ bushfire risk perceptions. The aim of this research was to investigate the concept of bushfire risk perception and its measurement, and to develop a brief, reliable and valid measure of householders’ bushfire risk perceptions. Following a review of 26 studies, a four-item householder bushfire risk perception scale (HBRPS-4) was developed. Analysis of responses to an online survey of 375 householders indicated that the measure had high internal consistency (α = 0.93). There was evidence of: construct validity, concurrent convergent criterion validity (|r| range 0.21–0.58), and concurrent discriminant criterion validity (r ≤ 0.15). A supplementary study with 27 participants found a high level of test-retest reliability over a six-week period (r = 0.95). It is suggested that householder bushfire risk perception can be construed as a fuzzy concept, incorporating three risk perception elements (probability, consequences, concern) whose meaning boundaries are not well-differentiated. The HBRPS-4 appears to hold promise of being a useful measure for community bushfire safety research.\r\n\r\n\r\nJarman, H.K., Slater, A., McLean, S.A., Marques, M.D., & Paxton, S.J. (2021). The impact of completing body image assessments on adolescents’ body image and engagement in body change strategies: Harmful or harmless? Body Image, 39, 131-138. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bodyim.2021.07.003Impact Factor = 6.406\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nParents and educators have raised concerns that participating in body image research may cause or increase poor body image and engagement in body change strategies. This quasi-experimental study compared body image and body change strategy outcomes among adolescents who had, and had not, previously been exposed to the same assessment questions 6-months prior (twice- vs once-completers). Comparison was also made between groups who completed an assessment containing only positively worded items or both positive and negative items (positive vs mixed valence). Boys and girls (N = 1,532, Mage = 13.83, SD = 1.18) completed online measures of body dissatisfaction, body appreciation, overvaluation of weight and shape, appearance esteem, and body change strategies. In regression analyses, neither body image nor body change strategies were predicted by group (completion or valence groups), except lower body dissatisfaction and higher body appreciation among twice-completers. Most participants did not experience individual-level change in body image or body change strategies over 6-months. Findings suggest that body image assessments may not put adolescents at risk of poor body image or engagement with body change strategies, however; experimental research is needed. Some improvement in body image may have implications for prospective and prevention research.\r\n\r\n\r\nJarman, H. K., Marques, M.D., McLean, S.A., Slater, A., & Paxton, S.J. (2021). Social media, body satisfaction and well-being among adolescents: A mediation model of appearance-ideal internalization and comparison. Body Image, 36, 139-148. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bodyim.2020.11.005Impact Factor = 6.406\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nDespite adolescents’ prolific use of social media, relationships between social media and body satisfaction and well-being are not yet well understood, especially among boys. This study tested a sociocultural model of body image within the context of social media among adolescent boys and girls. Specifically, this study examined whether appearance-ideal internalization and social appearance comparisons mediated relationships between social media engagement (intensity and appearance-focused use) and body satisfaction and subjective well-being. Australian adolescents between 11 and 17 years (N = 1,579, Mage = 13.45 years, SD = 1.15; 55.4 % boys) completed an online survey. Structural equational modelling indicated that only higher appearance-focused social media use was directly associated with lower body satisfaction and well-being. Generally, higher appearance-ideal internalization and comparisons mediated the relationships between higher social media engagement and lower body satisfaction and well-being. Multi-group analyses indicated these relationships were equivalent across gender. Findings supported the proposed model among boys and girls and extend existing theoretical knowledge to encompass male body image and well-being. Interventions which target internalization and comparisons in the context of social media are likely to be valuable in improving body satisfaction and subjective well-being in co-educational settings.\r\n\r\n\r\nJarman, H.

This study tested a proposed model of the relationships between motivations for social media use, types of social media engagement and body satisfaction and well-being. Responses to an online survey from 1432 Australian adolescents (Mage = 13.45 years, SD = 1.14, range 11–17; 55.4% boys) were collected. Structural equational modelling indicates excellent model fit. Specifically, motivations for social media use (information sharing, passing time, escapism, social interaction, social capital and appearance feedback) were associated with engagement (intensity, photo-based use, active use, passive use and liking use) and revealed mixed associations with body satisfaction and well-being. The findings support the importance of considering motivations for social media use in future research.\r\n\r\n\r\nJarman, H. K., McLean, S.A., Slater, A., Marques, M.D., & Paxton, S.J.

New Media and Society. https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448211058468Impact Factor = 8.061\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nCross-sectional research suggests a small, inverse association between social media use and body satisfaction. However, less is known regarding prospective, bidirectional, or mediating effects. In line with sociocultural theory, this study used a three-wave design to examine direct and indirect effects between social media use and body satisfaction, via thin-ideal and muscular-ideal internalisation and social comparisons. Adolescents (n = 1911; Mage = 14.27, SD = 1.08) were invited to complete three surveys over 1 year. Cross-lagged panel models indicated acceptable fit for two social media use operationalisations, with better fit statistics for the appearance-focused use rather than photo-based activities model. Despite largely no direct effects, indirect effects were found. Social comparisons mediated the relationships over time, whereby higher social media use predicted higher comparisons, which predicted lower body satisfaction. The reverse direction was also found. Gender invariance indicates that prevention aimed at reducing comparisons may be suitable for boys and girls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarques, M.D., Wright, B.J., Lee, C.H.J., & Sibley, C.G. (2021). Increased sleep predicts annual decreases in psychological distress: Results from a six-year longitudinal panel sample. Sleep Health, 78(3), 368-374. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2020.12.005 [PDF]Impact Factor = 4.450\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nObjective: To investigate the annual temporal ordering of sleep quantity and psychological distress, separating between-person stability from within-person change.\r\nDesign: Random-intercepts cross-lagged panel model using six annual waves of longitudinal data from the New Zealand Attitudes Values Study postal questionnaire.Participants: New Zealand Attitudes Values Study respondents in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 (Ns = 17,890; 15,757; 13,904; 21,849; 17,031; and 47,462).\r\nMeasurements: Participants were asked, “During the past month, on average, how many hours of actual sleep did you get per night?” and responded to the K6 psychological distress scale each year. They also reported their demographic characteristics.\r\nResults: Identified longitudinal associations between sleep duration and psychological distress in a traditional cross-lagged panel model were mostly attributable to the stability of the between-person differences in sleep duration and psychological distress. We provide evidence to suggest that increased sleep duration as indicated over a short period of time (i.e.,one month) predicted lower within-person levels of psychological distress the following year.Psychological distress did not predict sleep duration, in contrast.\r\nConclusions: Our analyses suggest that sleep duration in this sample of New Zealanders precedes psychological distress. This is significant given the propensity for short sleep in this sample and issues of poor mental health and short sleep among low SES indigenous membersof this community. The promotion of adequate sleep duration may yield positive gains in psychological well-being\r\n\r\n\r\nSteffens, M.S., Dunn, A.G., Marques, M.D., Danchin, M., Witteman, H.O., & Leask, J. (2021). Addressing Myths and Vaccine Hesitancy: A Randomized Trial. Pediatrics, e2020049304. https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-049304 [PDF]Impact Factor = 5.417\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nOBJECTIVES: Evidence on repeating vaccination misinformation or “myths” in debunking text is inconclusive; repeating myths may unintentionally increase agreement with myths or help discredit myths. In this study we aimed to compare the effect of repeating vaccination myths and other text-based debunking strategies on parents’ agreement with myths and their intention to vaccinate their children.\r\nMETHODS: For this online experiment we recruited 788 parents of children aged 0 to 5 years; 454 (58%) completed the study. We compared 3 text-based debunking strategies (repeating myths, posing questions, or making factual statements) and a control. We measured changes in agreement with myths and intention to vaccinate immediately after the intervention and at least 1 week later. The primary analysis compared the change in agreement with vaccination myths from baseline, between groups, at each time point after the intervention.\r\nRESULTS: There was no evidence that repeating myths increased agreement with myths compared with the other debunking strategies or the control. Posing questions significantly decreased agreement with myths immediately after the intervention compared with the control (difference: −0.30 points, 99.17% confidence interval: −0.58 to −0.02, P = .004, d = 0.39). There was no evidence of a difference between other debunking strategies or the control at either time point, or on intention to vaccinate.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Debunking strategies that repeat vaccination myths do not appear to be inferior to strategies that do not repeat myths.\r\n\r\n\r\nPiantella, S., Dragano, N., Marques, M.D., McDonald, S.J., & Wright, B.J.

Journal of Psychosomatic Research, 151, 110657. doi:\r\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110657Impact Factor = 3.006\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nOBJECTIVES: Stress, inflammation, and depression are associated to coronary heart disease (CHD). However, how these constructs collectively contribute to CHD incidence is not well understood. For the first time, this study explored the concurrent relationship between workplace stress, depression symptomology and levels of low-grade inflammation with future CHD incidence.\r\nMETHODS: Data from the 5-year intervals at phase 5, 7, and 9 of the Whitehall II study (N = 8348, Mage = 56) provided measures of workplace stress, depression symptomology, inflammation (interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen), and CHD incidence. The proposed stress-inflammation-depression-CHD pathway was assessed with a longitudinal design incorporating a structural equation model (SEM) that measured if changes in stress, depression, and inflammation between phase 5 to phase 7 predicted first-time CHD events between phases 7 and 9.\r\nRESULTS: The SEM empirically supported this proposed pathway and demonstrated excellent model fit, χ (72) = 3582.959, p < .001, CFI = 0.896, RMSEA = 0.076 (CI90 = 0.074, 0.079), while depression symptoms mediated the association between workplace stress and CHD incidence, B = 0.003 (CI90 = 0.001, 0.004). Further, survival analysis indicated that individuals with higher mean scores (across phases) of depression symptoms or fibrinogen levels were more likely to experience a first time CHD event.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Increases in depression symptoms and fibrinogen levels may be good indicators of future CHD morbidity among older employees. Future research is encouraged to monitor negative affective states and the potential use of biobehavioural options to reduce depression and inflammation that may mitigate CHD risk.\r\n\r\n\r\nRodgers, R.F., Mclean, S.A., Gordon, C.S., Slater, A., Marques, M.D., Jarman, H.K., & Paxton, S.J.

However, motivations for social media use has received little attention in extant research in the area of body image. The aim of this study was therefore to develop a measure of motivations for social media use among adolescents, with a focus on appearance motivations. Data from 770 adolescents (49% female), mean (SD) age = 12.76 (0.74) were used to examine the psychometric properties of the new Motivations for Social Media Use scale (MSMU). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses revealed a four-factor structure including Connection, Popularity, Appearance, and Values and Interests subscales. All subscales revealed acceptable internal reliability, and convergent validity with internalization of appearance ideals, self-esteem, and social media use. The MSMU is a useful tool for assessing appearance motivations for social media use among adolescent girls and boys.\r\n\r\n\r\nMcLennan, J., Marques, M.D., & Every, D. (2020). Conceptualising and measuring psychological preparedness for disaster: The Psychological Preparedness for Disaster Threat Scale. Natural Hazards, 101, 297–307. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-020-03866-4Impact Factor = 3.656\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nMost research on household disaster preparedness has focussed on physical, or material, preparation. Recently, researchers have turned attention to investigating psychological, or mental, preparedness for disasters. Reviews suggest that psychological preparedness comprises two broad mental dimensions or domains: a mostly cognitive aspect directed at the threat, involving knowledge of the threat environment and adaptive responses; and a mostly affective aspect involving self-awareness and emotional self-control. We located eight self-report measures of psychological preparedness, of which only three evidenced good psychometric properties. Of these, only the Psychological Preparedness for Disaster Threat Scale (PPDTS) developed by Zulch et al. (Psychological preparedness for natural disasters, 2012) seemed suitable for investigating psychological preparedness for disaster events in general in English-speaking contexts. A confirmatory factor analysis of data from a survey of 1253 Australian residents replicated the findings reported by Zulch et al. that the measure comprised two sub-scales: a 10-item Knowledge and Management sub-scale, and an 8-item Anticipation, Awareness and Management sub-scale. Evidence of both concurrent convergent and discriminant validity of the measure was found. The PPDTS appears to be a psychometrically sound self-report measure of householder psychological preparedness for a disaster event.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPetrovic, K.P., Stukas, A.A., & Marques, M.D. (2020). Religiosity, Motivations and Volunteering: A Test of Two Theories of Religious Prosociality. Journal of Theoretical Social Psychology, 4, 157-168. https://doi.org/10.1002/jts5.68 [PDF]Impact Factor = 1.341\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nAlthough it is well-established that religious individuals tend to volunteer more than the non-religious, few studies have examined motivations to volunteer as a potential explanation for this relationship. The present research takes a functional approach to examine whether religiosity drives volunteerism by promoting certain motivations for volunteering. Two common theories of religious prosociality are considered: (1) religious belief increases volunteering through internalized prosocial values, and (2) religious service attendance increases volunteering by fostering social relationships, hence increasing social reasons for volunteering. In two studies, Values-based and Social-based motivations to volunteer are tested as mediators in the relationship between religiosity (both belief and service attendance) and volunteering. Study 1 used a predominantly university student sample (N = 130) to predict volunteering intentions, whereas Study 2 employed an Australian community sample (N = 772) to predict self-reported volunteer hours. Both studies show consistent findings that the Values motive mediated the relationship between religious belief and volunteering, whereas the Social motive did not mediate the relationship between religious service attendance and volunteering. We find support for the theory that religious beliefs boost volunteerism by promoting humanistic reasons for volunteering.\r\n\r\n\r\nMcLean S.A., Wertheim E.H., Marques, M.D., & Paxton S.J. (2019).

Adolescent girls (N = 260) were randomly allocated to a media literacy (Happy Being Me – Media Literacy) or appearance comparison (Happy Being Me – Appearance Comparison) intervention or healthy eating behaviour control (Happy Being Me – Healthy Eating Behaviour) condition. In the Happy Being Me – Appearance Comparison condition, improvements from baseline to post-programme and follow-up for upward appearance comparison and fear of negative appearance evaluation were observed. In the Happy Being Me – Media Literacy condition, improvements were observed from baseline to post-programme for upward appearance comparison and realism scepticism. Findings were similar in a high-risk subsample and overall are moderately supportive of appearance comparison-based interventions, but less supportive of a stand-alone media literacy intervention.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarques, M.D., Elphinstone B., Critchley C.R., & Eigenberger, M.E.

Using seven samples, the study examined several psychometric components of the measure, including equivalency across community and student/convenience populations, temporal stability, and indications of different forms of validity. The scale was designed to be a brief, reliable and valid measure of individual differences in the degree to which individuals value affect-reinforced need for intellectual engagement. These results suggest that the Anti-Intellectualism Scale may provide a useful tool for the examination of differences in the desire to engage in intellectually challenging activities, and subsequent outcomes such as vocational interest, academic achievement, and democratic citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\nHoneyman K.L., Stukas A.A., & Marques M.D. (2016).

Past research has identified emotional reactions to victims of trafficking, as well as the perceived cost and efficacy of actions, as significant predictors of willingness to get involved. We surveyed 216 Australians (70% female) to assess their perceptions of sex and labor trafficking and actions to reduce them. Results demonstrated that women reported greater personal distress (but not empathy) for victims than men, which was associated with greater willingness to take action. Women also perceived available actions to be more efficacious than men, which predicted willingness, while perceived cost of actions did not. Implications for promoting social action to reduce human trafficking are discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\nRodgers, R.F., McLean, S.A., Marques, M., Dunstan, C., & Paxton, S.J. (2016).

We examined longitudinal patterns of development of body dissatisfaction and dietary restriction among early adolescent girls within a sociocultural framework. A sample of 259 school girls (Mage = 12.76 years, SD = 0.44) reported on sociocultural influences, body dissatisfaction and dietary restriction at baseline, 8, and 14 months. A subsample provided height and weight. Analyses identified four trajectories of body dissatisfaction: low, moderate-increasing, moderate-decreasing, and high. Three trajectories of dietary restriction emerged: low, moderate, and high. Baseline and 8-month sociocultural variables and BMI differed between the trajectories. A subgroup of girls displays high levels of body image and eating concerns by early adolescence. Sociocultural variables influence these trajectories.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarques, M.D., Critchley, C.R., & Walshe, J. (2015).

Nationally representative samples (*N8 = 8821) over 10 years showed Australians were less positive toward genetically modified animals compared to genetically modified plants for food, especially in years where media coverage was high. Structural equation modeling found that positive attitudes toward different genetically modified organisms for food were significantly associated with higher trust in scientists and regulators (e.g. governments), and with lower trust in watchdogs (e.g. environmental movement). Public trust in scientists and watchdogs was a stronger predictor of attitudes toward the use of genetically modified plants for food than animals, but only when media coverage was low. Results are discussed regarding the moral acceptability of genetically modified organisms for food, the media’s role in shaping public opinion, and the role public trust in organizations has on attitudes toward genetically modified organisms.\r\n\r\n\r\nKashima, E.S., Beatson, R., Branchflower, S., Kaufmann, L., & Marques, M.D. (2014).

Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 45, 1534-1548. https://doi.org/10.1177/0022022114543521Impact Factor = 2.577\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nTerror Management Theory predicts that mortality salience (MS) instigates cultural worldview defenses, especially among individuals with lower self-esteem. That MS intensifies positive evaluations of pro-U.S. essay authors, and negative evaluations of anti-U.S. essay authors have been documented as supportive evidence. However, the evidence to date may have been limited to where praising for the former and rejection of the latter authors is consistent with a shared cultural script and thus normative. In the case of Australian people, the cultural script of cringe prescribes them to evaluate their country modestly and to reject high praise of their country. We therefore predicted that MS (vs. control) should lead Australians, with low self-esteem in particular, to evaluate pro-Australia essay authors less positively while not affecting their evaluations of anti-Australia essay authors. Results from two studies were consistent with this prediction. It is important to distinguish MS effects on adherence to cultural norms from those on reaffirming collective self-esteem, and to consider relevant cultural scripts when interpreting evidence for worldview defenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
