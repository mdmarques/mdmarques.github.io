## Bio

Dr Mathew Marques is a Lecturer in Psychology at La Trobe University, Melbourne.

He uses social psychology to understand the role of psychological mechanisms (e.g., trust, conspiracy theories, ideologies) in the formation of attitudes towards socially contentious scientific research (e.g., genetically modified foods, vaccinations), and more broadly in science communication.

Mathew is also interested in the role of epistemological processes such as anti-intellectualism in the evaluation of emerging technologies, and how these and other values shape judgments of scientific actors.
